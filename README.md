# Summer-internship_2024

##  13th May 2024

## Introduction
 This repository documents my experiences, learning, and projects during my summer internship as a Data Analyst and Machine learning Developer, starting from May 13th, 2024, and concluding on July 25th, 2024.

 ##  Internship Overview
 My summer internship at Clumoss began on May 13th, 2024, and will conclude on July 25th, 2024. As a Data Analyst, I am responsible for working with Power BI, Jupyter, and Python to analyze and visualize data, providing insights and supporting decision-making processes along with implementing Machine Learning models to predict the desired output.
 
 ## Week 1(:13/05/2024 To :19/05/2024 )
 ## Overview
-Briefing and creating plans related to upcpming projects and learning about it . <br>
During the first week, I focused on understanding the requirements for the college recommendation system and setting up the initial project structure.

## Tasks Completed
1Requirement analysis
2 Research on existing recommendation systems
3 Setting up the project structure
4 Initial setup of the development environment
5 collecting data for our data set

## Learnings
- Basic concepts of recommendation systems
- Tools and technologies to be used
-Learnt the tf-id-vectorizer algorithm.
## Week 2(20/05/2024 To :26/05/2024 )
## Overview
In the second week, I started implementing the data collection and preprocessing modules.

## Tasks Completed
1. Creating a dummy dataset for students in Canada.
2. Implementing Python code to analyze and recommend data.
3. Learning to train models.
4. Getting accurate recommendations.

## Learnings
- Data preprocessing techniques
- EDA methods and tools
 # Week 3(:11/05/2024 To :15/05/2024 )

## Overview
The third week was dedicated to developing the recommendation algorithm and model training.

## Tasks Completed
1. Made an ai to generate the prompt.
2. Write a program of basic ai image generating prompt.
3.Used python libraries.
4. Found a suitable output for that program.
## Learnings
- Collaborative filtering and content-based filtering
- Model evaluation metrics
 # Week 4(15/05/2024 To :20/05/2024 )

## Overview
In the final week, I focused on integrating the recommendation system with a user interface and conducting testing.

## Tasks Completed
1.	Made a ai propmpt with advance programing
2. found  a dummy data for shirt selling.
3. Used tf-idvectorizer algoritham.
4. ## Learnings
- Testing and debugging techniques
